    .. exercise::

        From `Molecule of the Month <https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/motm-by-date>`_ listing of `Protein Data Bank <https://www.rcsb.org/>`_, select one molecule that you like.
        Download coordinate files and open them in VMD.
        Adjust VMD representations to show the molecule so that you can describe its features, structural details and/or functional determinants.
        Present your molecule to the rest of the group.
